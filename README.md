# Stock Ticker Logos
Mostly transparent logos for (almost) all NYSE & NASDAQ stock companies.

Some logos have been selected, or modified, to be white or lighter for our dark themed website. Some logos have been made transparent, resulting in some rough edges that aren't very notceable in our use case- they are listed below.
#
**Some logos are missing or do not have transparent backgrounds.** We ask that if you are using this repository, consider contributing missing or transparent logos.

List of tickers with no transparent logos: (some were made transparent, but edges are rough): CFVI, ANPC, PETZ, NMTC, WAFU, SNTG, RVAC, HUMA, BCDA, ENVX, BON, PSHG, ALLR, NVFY

(There are many more, started this list on 9/02- so no one would check the same logos twice)
